//!
//! Rustler is a library for writing Erlang NIFs in safe Rust code. That means there should be no
//! ways to crash the BEAM (Erlang VM). The library provides facilities for generating the
//! boilerplate for interacting with the BEAM, handles encoding and decoding of Erlang terms, and
//! catches rust panics before they unwind into C.
//!
//! The library provides functionality for both Erlang and Elixir, however Elixir is favored as of
//! now.
//!
//! This crate provides the entire runtime library for rustler. Code generators are located in the
//! rustler_codegen library.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//! There is a [`:rustler`](https://hex.pm/packages/rustler) package on hex.pm that provides
//! functionality which makes working with Rustler easier, including project generators, an
//! automatic NIF compiler for Mix, and utilities for loading the compiled NIF.
//!
//! For more information about this, see [the documentation for
//! rustler_mix](https://hexdocs.pm/rustler/basics.html).
